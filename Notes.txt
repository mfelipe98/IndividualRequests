Notes:

2 simulations can be found here: OldIndividualRequestSimulation contains the conference appraoch (centralized, coarse-grained) and IndividualRequestSimulation contains the journal approach (decentralized, fine-grained).

Each of these simulations writes the following to the output.txt files: Time taken to complete a request, with each row representing set of 30 simulations for each search length (note that this looks exactly similar to the data stored in the excel file for this case study)

They can each be ran to generate another set of simulations.
